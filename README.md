# market-tracker
This application is used to view stock market data, including stock and commodity prices, financial news, and company financials in order to make correct decisions when trading in the stock market.

The first part of the project is the main page. This page includes a price chart with the major indices(DJI, S&P, NDQ) depending on the time of day. At night and on off days, it will display the futures market charts, while when the market is in session (9:30-4:00) on an open day, it will display the regular price quotes from the indices. It will also include a stream of news from important financial news providers. It will also include economic releases and events that are scheduled to happen in the week ahead, with a more in depth calendar available on a separate page. The main page will also include futures prices on for a list of commodities. 

The main page includes all aspects of the bigger parts but in a simplified form... 

Other features:
- Portfolio tracker with price alerts (email/twilio)
- Full commodity price list 
- Page with bond yields, corporate and government
- Page for each sector, banking, transport, etc.
