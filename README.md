# market-tracker
This application is used to view stock market data, including stock and commodity prices, financial news, and company financials in order to make correct decisions when trading in the stock market.

The first part of the project is the main page. This page includes a price chart with the major indices(DJI, S&P, NDQ) depending on the time of day. At night and on off days, it will display the futures market charts, while when the market is in session (9:30-4:00) on an open day, it will display the regular price quotes from the indices. It will also include a stream of news from important financial news providers. It will also include economic releases and events that are scheduled to happen in the week ahead, with a more in depth calendar available on a separate page. The main page will also include futures prices on for a list of commodities, foreign exchange rates, bond market performance, sector peformance, and a place to put your watchlist. It will also include a small summary of the percent change of a portfolio. All of these widgets will have to ability to be clicked on and bring you to a bigger page with a more in depth summary of each thing, where you can also customize what information you are viewing.
